Shelldone is just a shell written in C from scratch so I can play with it.
I guess it will never be as complete as zsh/csh/bash/whatever, but actually it
is not my goal.
I'm just working on it to learn and improve my skills in C programming.

Compilation
-----------

$ make

Execution
---------

$ ./shelldone
