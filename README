Shelldone is just a shell written in C from scratch so I can play with it.
I guess it will never be as complete as zsh/csh/bash/whatever, but actually it
is not my goal.
I'm just working on it to learn and improve my skills in C programming.

Compilation
-----------

$ make

Execution
---------

$ ./shelldone

Features
--------

- Jobs control (command jobs, fg, bg + SIGTSTP (^Z) )
- Arguments protection: "an example", 'another example'
- Multi-line commands (with a final backslash (\) )
- Multiple commands: ls | grep .c && echo OK
- Background commands: sleep 120 &
- Extensible with modules (see README in plugins directory)
